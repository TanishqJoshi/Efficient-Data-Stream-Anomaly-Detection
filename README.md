# Efficient-Data-Stream-Anomaly-Detection
This project simulates a continuous data stream with seasonal, trend, and noise components, while detecting anomalies using Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA). It features real-time data visualization and anomaly detection, making it ideal for real-time monitoring systems.
